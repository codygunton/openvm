# OpenVM Instructions Component Documentation

## Component Overview

The `openvm-instructions` crate provides the core instruction representation and opcode management system for the OpenVM zkVM framework. This component defines the instruction format, opcode dispatch system, program representation, and utility functions that form the foundation of OpenVM's instruction set architecture (ISA).

## Core Architecture

### Key Components

1. **VmOpcode & LocalOpcode System**: Global opcode management with class-based organization
   - Maps local opcodes to global namespace with offset-based addressing
   - Supports hierarchical opcode organization across different instruction classes
   - Provides type-safe opcode conversion and field element integration

2. **Instruction Structure**: Standard 7-operand instruction format
   - Fixed-width instruction representation with opcode + 7 operands (a-g)
   - Field-generic design supporting different prime fields
   - Flexible operand interpretation based on instruction semantics

3. **Program Representation**: Executable program container with debug support
   - PC-indexed instruction storage with configurable step size
   - Optional debug information attachment for each instruction
   - Serialization support for program persistence and transport

4. **System Opcodes**: Core VM operations and control flow
   - TERMINATE: Program termination instruction
   - PHANTOM: No-op instruction for trace alignment
   - PUBLISH: Output publication instruction

## Technical Implementation Details

### Opcode Management System

The component implements a two-level opcode system:

```rust
pub trait LocalOpcode {
    const CLASS_OFFSET: usize;      // Base offset for this opcode class
    fn from_usize(value: usize) -> Self;
    fn local_usize(&self) -> usize;
    fn global_opcode(&self) -> VmOpcode;
}

#[repr(C)]
pub struct VmOpcode(usize);  // Global opcode identifier
```

**Key Properties:**
- Class-based organization prevents opcode conflicts between extensions
- Local-to-global mapping enables distributed opcode management
- Type-safe conversion between representations
- Direct field element conversion for constraint generation

### Instruction Format

The standard instruction format provides a uniform interface:

```rust
#[repr(C)]
pub struct Instruction<F> {
    pub opcode: VmOpcode,  // Operation identifier
    pub a: F,              // Primary operand/result
    pub b: F,              // Secondary operand
    pub c: F,              // Third operand
    pub d: F,              // Fourth operand
    pub e: F,              // Fifth operand
    pub f: F,              // Sixth operand
    pub g: F,              // Seventh operand
}
```

**Design Rationale:**
- Fixed 7-operand format accommodates most instruction types
- Field-generic design supports different prime fields
- Repr(C) ensures consistent memory layout
- Builder methods support various operand count patterns

### Program Structure

Programs are represented as collections of instructions with metadata:

```rust
pub struct Program<F> {
    pub instructions_and_debug_infos: Vec<Option<(Instruction<F>, Option<DebugInfo>)>>,
    pub step: u32,      // PC increment per instruction (typically 4)
    pub pc_base: u32,   // Base program counter value
}
```

**Key Features:**
- Sparse instruction storage (Some/None) for efficiency
- Configurable PC stepping (default 4 for RISC-V compatibility)
- Debug information preservation for development tools
- Serialization support for program distribution

## Integration Points

### With OpenVM Core
- Provides instruction format consumed by VM execution engine
- Opcode system integrates with chip dispatch mechanisms
- Program structure used by trace generation and verification

### With Extensions
- LocalOpcode trait enables extension-specific opcode definition
- Class offset system prevents conflicts between extensions
- Instruction format accommodates diverse operation types

### With Transpiler
- Program structure targets transpilation from ELF binaries
- Debug information preserves source mapping
- PC stepping matches RISC-V instruction alignment

### With RISC-V Support
- Compatible PC stepping (4-byte increments)
- Instruction format accommodates RISC-V encoding patterns
- System opcodes provide necessary VM control primitives

## Opcode Class Organization

The component defines several opcode classes with reserved ranges:

- **System Opcodes** (0x000-0x01F): Core VM operations
  - TERMINATE (0x000): Program termination
  - PHANTOM (0x001): No-operation placeholder

- **Publish Opcodes** (0x020-0x03F): Output operations
  - PUBLISH (0x020): Publish values to public output

- **Development Opcodes** (0xDEADAF+): Internal development use
  - REPLACE_ME: Placeholder for unimplemented operations

## Performance Characteristics

### Memory Efficiency
- Sparse instruction storage reduces memory usage
- Fixed instruction size enables efficient indexing
- Optional debug information minimizes runtime overhead

### Execution Efficiency
- Direct opcode-to-usize conversion for fast dispatch
- Field element conversion optimized for constraint generation
- Minimal indirection in instruction access patterns

### Serialization Performance
- Custom serialization for instructions with debug info
- Bitcode-compatible encoding for efficient storage
- Streaming-friendly program representation

## Security Properties

### Type Safety
- LocalOpcode trait prevents invalid opcode construction
- Field-generic design ensures type consistency
- Repr(C) layout prevents memory safety issues

### Opcode Isolation
- Class-based offsets prevent accidental opcode conflicts
- Global opcode space managed centrally
- Local opcode ranges verified at compile time

### Program Integrity
- Immutable instruction structure after construction
- Debug information separation from execution semantics
- Serialization preserves program structure exactly

## Common Usage Patterns

### Opcode Definition
```rust
#[derive(LocalOpcode)]
#[opcode_offset = 0x100]
#[repr(usize)]
pub enum MyOpcode {
    ADD,     // Global opcode: 0x100
    SUB,     // Global opcode: 0x101
    MUL,     // Global opcode: 0x102
}
```

### Instruction Creation
```rust
// From sized operands
let inst = Instruction::from_usize(opcode, [a, b, c]);

// From signed operands
let inst = Instruction::from_isize(opcode, a, b, c, d, e);

// Manual construction
let inst = Instruction::new(opcode, a_field, b_field, /* ... */);
```

### Program Building
```rust
let mut program = Program::new_empty(4, 0);
program.add_instruction(inst1, debug_info1);
program.add_instruction(inst2, None);
```

## Error Handling and Debugging

### Runtime Validation
- PC bounds checking against MAX_ALLOWED_PC
- Step size validation for alignment requirements
- Opcode range validation in debug builds

### Debug Support
- Optional debug information per instruction
- Source location preservation through transpilation
- Backtrace integration for execution tracing

### Common Issues
- Opcode offset conflicts between extensions
