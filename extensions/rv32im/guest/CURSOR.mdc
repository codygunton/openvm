# RISC-V 32-bit IM Guest Library

Guest-side library providing low-level primitives for VM custom instructions and hint stream interaction.

## Key Integration Pattern
- Custom instruction macros wrap inline assembly for VM-specific operations
- Hint stream operations for non-deterministic input handling during execution

## Important Constraints
- No-std environment - all code must work without standard library
- Target-specific compilation - conditional compilation for zkvm target vs native
- Direct hardware interface - macros generate specific RISC-V opcodes for VM operations
