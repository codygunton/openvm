# FRI (Fast Reed-Solomon Interactive Oracle Proof) Component AI Documentation

## Overview

The FRI component implements the reduced opening operation for the Fast Reed-Solomon Interactive Oracle Proof protocol within OpenVM. This operation computes a polynomial evaluation using a rolling hash technique over field extension elements, essential for STARK proof generation and verification.

## Core Algorithm

### FRI Reduced Opening
The component computes: `result = sum_{i=0}^{length-1} alpha^(length-1-i) * (b_i - a_i)`

Where:
- `alpha`: Field extension element (degree 4)
- `a`: Sequence of base field elements
- `b`: Sequence of field extension elements
- `result`: Field extension element

### Rolling Hash Computation
The computation proceeds incrementally:
```
result_0 = 0
result_{i+1} = result_i * alpha + (b_i - a_i)
```

## Architecture

### Three-Phase Execution Model

The FRI chip uses a unique three-phase execution model for each instruction:

1. **Workload Rows**: Multiple rows that perform the actual computation
   - Each row processes one (a, b) pair
   - Maintains rolling hash state
   - Updates pointers and indices

2. **Instruction1 Row**: Setup and configuration
   - Reads instruction operands
   - Fetches alpha, length, and pointers
   - Initiates the computation

3. **Instruction2 Row**: Completion and result writing
   - Writes final result to memory
   - Validates computation completion
   - Transitions to next instruction

### Column Layout

The component uses a unified column structure with 27 columns total:

#### General Columns (3)
- `is_workload_row`: Indicates workload phase
- `is_ins_row`: Indicates instruction phase
- `timestamp`: Execution timestamp

#### Data Columns (12)
- `a_ptr`, `b_ptr`: Current pointers
- `write_a`: Write vs read mode for a-values
- `idx`: Current index in computation
- `result[4]`: Rolling hash state
- `alpha[4]`: Field extension element

#### Auxiliary Columns
- Memory read/write auxiliary columns for verification
- Additional control flags and pointers

## Memory Access Patterns

### Initialization Phase (Instruction1)
1. Read `alpha` from memory (4 words)
2. Read `length` value
3. Read `a_ptr` and `b_ptr` base addresses
4. Read `is_init` flag
5. Optional: Read hint_id for streaming

### Workload Phase
For each element i (in reverse order):
1. Read or write `a[i]` based on `write_a` flag
2. Read `b[i]` (4 words for extension element)
3. Update rolling hash computation

### Completion Phase (Instruction2)
1. Write final `result` to memory (4 words)

## Key Features

### Field Extension Support
- Native support for degree-4 field extensions
- Efficient multiplication and addition in extension field
- Proper handling of field arithmetic constraints

### Hint Streaming
- Optional initialization of a-values from hint stream
- Controlled by `is_init` flag
- Enables efficient witness generation

### Memory Safety
- All accesses go through MemoryBridge
- Proper offline memory checking
- Address validation and bounds checking

## Instruction Format

### FRI_REDUCED_OPENING Opcode
```
Operands:
- a: a_ptr_ptr (pointer to a-values pointer)
- b: b_ptr_ptr (pointer to b-values pointer)
- c: length_ptr (pointer to array length)
- d: alpha_ptr (pointer to alpha value)
- e: result_ptr (pointer to store result)
- f: hint_id_ptr (hint stream identifier)
- g: is_init_ptr (initialization flag)
```

## Constraint System

### Transition Constraints
1. Proper phase transitions: Workload → Instruction1 → Instruction2
2. Correct pointer increments between workload rows
3. Valid index countdown from length to 0

### Computation Constraints
1. Rolling hash update: `result_new = result_old * alpha + (b - a)`
2. Field extension arithmetic correctness
3. Proper initialization and finalization

### Memory Constraints
1. Valid read/write operations at correct timestamps
2. Address consistency across phases
3. Proper data flow between phases

## Performance Characteristics

### Trace Dimensions
- **Height**: 2 + length (for each FRI instruction)
- **Width**: 27 columns (unified structure)

### Operation Count
- Setup: 5 memory reads
- Per element: 1-2 memory operations
- Completion: 1 memory write
- Field ops: length multiplications + additions

### Optimization Opportunities
1. Batch multiple FRI operations
2. Sequential memory access patterns
3. Hint streaming for witness generation
4. Minimal auxiliary column usage
